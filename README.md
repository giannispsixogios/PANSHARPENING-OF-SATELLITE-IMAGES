# PANSHARPENING-OF-SATELLITE-IMAGES
This python script performs pansharpening of satellite images, where the one image is a panchromatic image of a single band with the highest resolution, and the other image if a multispectral image of many bands with lower resolution. Both images should represent the exact same area of study.
